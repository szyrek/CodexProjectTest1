# Task File Example

This file illustrates the expected format for planned tasks. It is not an actual request.

Task files outline single pieces of work for agents. Each file name should follow `YYYY-MM-DD_<role>.agent.md`.
Keep the description short so it can be pasted into the Codex web interface.

Example contents:

```
Implement login endpoint for the API.

Dependencies:
- 2025-07-24_backend_setup.agent.md
```

# Request to Hire Developers

Please create two new roles:
1. **ts_dev** - responsible for implementing the TypeScript physics library and demo.
2. **qa_engineer** - responsible for writing automated tests.

I have added planned tasks for both roles. Once the roles are onboarded, please move the new task files to `work/in_progress/` as appropriate.

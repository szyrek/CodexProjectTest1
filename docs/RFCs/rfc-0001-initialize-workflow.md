# RFC-0001 Initialize Workflow

## Summary
Establish the initial multi-agent workflow, governance files, and CI structure.

## Motivation
Provide a consistent process for Codex to manage role assumptions, documentation, and continuous integration.

## Guide-level Explanation
- Create `WORKFLOW.md` and `AGENTS.md` to document workflow rules.
- Seed `/docs/` with placeholders for RFCs, ADRs, QA, Security, and Glossary.
- Configure GitHub Actions for lint, test, coverage, and doc parity checks.
- Introduce the PM role via `/roles/request/pm.md`.

## Reference-level Explanation
This RFC defines the repository scaffolding and baseline governance. Future RFCs may refine specific processes or tooling once project requirements are known.

## Unresolved Questions
- Specific languages and tooling for CI (to be defined by the PM after requirements gathering).
